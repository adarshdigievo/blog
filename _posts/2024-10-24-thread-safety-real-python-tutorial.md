My first tutorial for Real Python got published ðŸŽ‰

"Python Thread Safety: Using a Lock and Other Techniques": [https://realpython.com/python-thread-lock/](https://realpython.com/python-thread-lock/)

### Why thread safety?

Below is a classic example of creating a singleton class is Python:

```python
class SingletonClass(object):
  def __new__(cls):
    if not hasattr(cls, 'instance'):
      cls.instance = super(SingletonClass, cls).__new__(cls)
    return cls.instance
```

The `SingletonClass` is supposed to have only 1 object, but the code can lead to the creation of more than one instances
when executed in a multithreaded environment.

Read the tutorial to spot such race conditions and learn to fix them using Python's synchronization primitives.
