## About Me

Hi, I’m Adarsh Divakaran👋

I’m currently building [Lexoga](https://lexoga.com) — a platform reimagining how people connect with high-leverage work in the AI era. It's part of our parent company, [Digievo Labs](https://digievo.in), where we explore bold ideas in tech and the future of work.

My core tech expertise is in Python and backend development. I love designing systems, writing clean APIs, and working behind the scenes to make things run fast and reliably.

I’m also a speaker at global Python conferences like **PyCon US**, **EuroPython**, **DjangoCon US**, **PyCascades**, and **PiterPy**. You can find all my talk resources in [this GitHub repo](https://github.com/adarshdigievo/talks).

Let’s connect on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adarsh-d) 🤝
